# Time Series Clustering

This github conatins the analytical model i developed to detect regular and irregular motor current profiles of point machines. 
Every point machine's swing, either Normal to Reverse or Reverse to Normal, is associated with motor current profile. The current value for every 10ms is captured by condition monitoring system. On an average, a swing has ~500 current values with 10ms interval. Hence, each swing can be considered as time sequence/time series. Using unsupervised machine learning, I've tried to detect regular and irregular motor current profiles of point machines.

## Overview


## Motivation
I was approached by one of my colleagues to help him to efficienly detect sub-optimal performance of point machines using the condition monitoring data. My colleague was spending a lot of time in observing current profiles and then defining threshold to detect abnormalities. The current profiles vary not only from machice type to machine type but also from machine to machine of same type. 

Later on the problem statement was clearly defined and then commuinicated to senior leadership team. Eventually I was given go-ahead to start developing a model to efficiently detect abnormality using machine learning technique.     


## Technical Aspect
This project is divided into 3 parts:
1. Accessing the backend data from the condition monitoring system
2. Extracting & Transforming the data to fit tis
